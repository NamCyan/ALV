# Auxiliary Local Variables for Improving Regularization/Prior Approach in Continual Learning

This repository contains the code for ALV. ALV is a method that can boost the performance of regularization-based methods in continual learning using novel auxiliary variables. The paper on ALV is published at PAKDD'22.

# Our contributions
1. This work introduces a novel method which adds auxiliary local variables for each task to the model in continual learning scenarios.

2. ALV can be applied in both Bayesian and Deterministic NN architectures.

3. We conducted various experiments to show that ALV can make standard methods approach the state-of-the-art results.
